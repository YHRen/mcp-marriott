```

### 2. Install Playwright browsers

This server uses secure, encrypted storage for your session. To log in, use the `login` tool provided by the server. It will provide a secure login URL where you can enter your credentials manually in your browser.

### 4. Configure Claude Desktop

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "marriott": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["github:YHRen/mcp-marriott"]
    }
  }
}
```

        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["github:YHRen/mcp-marriott"]
      }

## Usage Examples

### Search hotels

```
Search for Marriott hotels in Tokyo from July 10-15 for 2 adults
```

### Book a room

```
Find me a room at the W Hotel Times Square for next weekend, then book the cheapest option
```

### Check Bonvoy status

```
How many Bonvoy points do I have and what's my current tier?
```

### Redeem points

```
Use my Bonvoy points to book a standard room at the Marriott Marquis in NYC for March 20-22
```

### Manage a reservation

```
Show me my upcoming reservations and cancel the one in Chicago
```

## Session Management

Cookies are saved to `~/.striderlabs/marriott/` so sessions persist between runs. To log out:

```
Use the logout tool
```

Or delete the directory:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.striderlabs/marriott/
```

## Safety & Confirmations

**Destructive actions require explicit confirmation:**

- `checkout` — requires `confirm: true`
- `modify_reservation` — requires `confirm: true`
- `cancel_reservation` — requires `confirm: true`
- `redeem_points` — requires `confirm: true`

Without `confirm: true`, these tools return a **preview** of what would happen, giving users a chance to review before committing.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YHRen/mcp-marriott
cd mcp-marriott
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```
